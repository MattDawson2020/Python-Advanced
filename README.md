## üêç Python-Advanced

- Chapters 25, 27, 28 , 30 and 31 from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Moves into advanced use cases and libraries
    * Class syntax, constructors and inheritance
    * Using OpenCV to process video capture from  webcam
    * Using Bokev to create modern and much more intuitive data visualisation from CSV data
    * Webscraping with BeautifulSoup


## üí≠ Thoughts so far

- Python is an exceptionally powerful language and puts extremely advanced capabilities in your hands with very minimal syntax/ difficulty to learn
- There seems to be a library for quite literally any use case you would need, and most are quite simple to use
- Python block syntax is much easier to read in large codebases than the usualy {} syntax when spread across multiple lines
- It often takes less than an hour to throw together displays/ data analysis that would likely take me days or weeks to put together in other languages
